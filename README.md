# Randomness API

This is an API made by me using FastAPI to get random facts and website links. This was initially made to be used in
[my bot](https://github.com/MarzaElise/Hutch-Bot), but its out in the public for anyone to use.

## Release

This is currently hosted in heroku which you can visit by clicking [here](https://randomness-api.herokuapp.com)
